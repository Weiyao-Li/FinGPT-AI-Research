# FinGPT-AI-Research

## Replicating FinGPT

### Inference
Utilized the FinGPT API from Hugging Face for direct inference and reported test results. [Benchmarks](https://github.com/Weiyao-Li/FinGPT-AI-Research/blob/main/benchmarks.ipynb)

### Benchmark Results for Financial Sentiment Analysis Tasks:
Employed a base model(ChatGLM2-6B) to follow the LoRA training process. Compared the performance of the custom-trained model with the direct inference results. [LoRA with ChatGLM2-6B](https://github.com/Weiyao-Li/FinGPT-AI-Research/blob/main/with_4_benchmarks_LORA_with_Chatglm2_6b.ipynb)

### Base Model Comparison
Conducted experiments with multiple base models for LoRA training, including InternLM, Falcon, llama2, and ChatGLM2. Compared their respective performances.
